# Kittens Game Cheats

## What does this do and why?

If you're addicted to http://www.bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/ here's your therapy.

This will unlock everything (all research, buildings, and resources)
and give you a trillion of each resource.

## Usage

Start off with a fresh game (may corrupt your existing one, so use a different browser profile if you care about your data).

Press save (it's on the top-right corner)

Then paste the following code into your chrome's URL bar and press enter (you can see the source code [here](https://github.com/gkovacs/kittens_game_cheats/blob/master/kittens_game_cheats.js))

\`\`\`javascript
javascript:(function(){${minified_js}})();
\`\`\`

The page will refresh, and you should have your one-trillion resources. Have fun!

## Usage (alternative)

If pasting the code into the URL bar did not work, try doing the following:

Open the javascript console (on chrome, you can open it with \`Control-Shift-J\` or \`Command-Shift-J\`, or by going to tools -> developer tools)

Copy-paste the code below (you can see the source code [here](https://github.com/gkovacs/kittens_game_cheats/blob/master/kittens_game_cheats.js)) and then press enter.

\`\`\`javascript
${minified_js}
\`\`\`
